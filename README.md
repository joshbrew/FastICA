# FastICA
2x2 special fast case and n-dimensional general form Fast ICA test with visualized test results. The reconstructed waveform quality can vary, refresh multiple times to see, this has to do with the underlying randomization of our ICA implementation so you want to run multiple passes to see how results average out. The demo uses a DFT to estimate the dominant frequency in the independent components so it is authentically testing for component freqs. For each signal source you need a sensor basically.
